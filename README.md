# LinkListProject

> A linklist project I created to understand the inner workings of the datastructure

# What I Learned

> Correclty implamenting a working link list w/ useful functions

> Advantages/Disadvantages of linklists

> Time Complexities of each function

> Debugging! It was a mess but now I learned the hard way.

# Future Ideas

> Instead of traversing through link list to find its  "index"; create a unordered map
> and pair the nodes memory address with the correct "index".
> Diffucult to implament because any modification to the link list would require updating 
> all "indexies".

> Optimizing sorting algorithm used, slow.

> Fixing code (removing unecessary code, fixing hacky code, removing redundent code, space/time complexity optimization)
